# Jump And Slide JavaScript Game
 This feature is something you see in a lot of 2D games such as the Prince of Persia, which was my inspiration for this video. We have done some jumping games but not ones that allow us to move left and right as well as jump so hopefully, this is useful to you and you will understand a little bit more about storing booleans in variables and why that can be useful.
